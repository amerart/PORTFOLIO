    <h2>Portrait Of The Artist: Amer Musa</h2>
    <p><em>Sudanese refugee Amer Musa, now based in Paris, shares how art became his therapy and his voice. As his colorful, geometric works appear in new exhibitions, he reflects on his journey, struggles, and dreams.</em></p>

    <h3>Interview</h3>

    <p><strong>Q: Amer, can you tell us about your journey from Sudan to Paris?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I left Sudan in 2014 as a refugee. I never imagined that I would become an artist. When I arrived in France in 2017, I found myself homeless in Paris. It was a very hard time—I didn’t speak the language, and I had nothing but time and my thoughts.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How did art enter your life during that time?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I started drawing in public libraries. At first, it was just to pass time and calm my anxiety. Soon, I realized that drawing was helping me heal—it became my therapy. I didn’t stop after that.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What inspires your artwork today?</strong></p>
    <p>A: My work is mostly geometric and minimal. I use simple shapes, patterns, and a few strong colors—black, red, yellow, blue. It reflects how I see life: organized, balanced, but with hidden emotions inside.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: You recently exhibited at Paul Smith in Paris. How did that happen?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I was very lucky. My work was noticed by people who believed in me. My exhibition, <strong>“A Big Dream”</strong>, was shown at Paul Smith stores in Rue de Grenelle and Boulevard Raspail. For me, it was a dream come true—showing my work in the city that gave me a second chance.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What does art mean to you now?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Art is my therapy, my voice, and my way to breathe. It’s a space where I feel free. Every drawing I make is like a conversation with myself, and I hope people can feel that connection when they see my work.</p>
