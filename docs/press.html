    <h2>As a new exhibition of his colourful, geometric work opens in Paris, we sat down with Amer Musa to discuss why art is therapy for him and why he feels lucky to live in Paris.</h2>

    <p>When Amer Musa left Sudan as a refugee in 2014, he had never contemplated becoming an artist. In fact, he’d never even drawn before. But when he arrived in France in 2017 and found himself homeless on the streets of Paris, he began to sketch. He needed an outlet for his anxiety and started to see drawing as a form of therapy. And he didn’t stop.</p>

    <p>Which brings us to today. Juggling a full-time job in the studio of a fashion designer, Amer is opening a new exhibition of his works at Rue de Grenelle and Boulevard Raspail in Paris. We spoke to him about how art gave new meaning to his life and why he’s still not sure he considers himself a “fully-fledged artist.”</p>

    <h3>Why did you become an artist?</h3>
    <p>As an amateur, I discovered my love for drawing and creating in the most unlikely circumstances. In 2017, as a homeless immigrant in Paris, I found solace and escape in public libraries where I started sketching and experimenting with colours. Sketching was a way to keep myself busy and avoid the toxicity of my condition. Soon, it became a passion that brought meaning and purpose to my life. Living in a city where art is everywhere makes me feel lucky.</p>

    <h3>Why do you work primarily in your medium?</h3>
    <p>I work mainly with markers and oil pastels because I enjoy the touch and the unique effects they create. These materials let me work quickly and spontaneously, without waiting for paint to dry. I’m drawn to geometric and abstract shapes, and my tools help me achieve that style.</p>

    <h3>Where do you find inspiration?</h3>
    <p>My inspiration comes from emotions, nature, and daily life. Sometimes it’s just a feeling or a moment I want to express. Other times it’s music, movies, or the work of other artists. I believe inspiration can come from anywhere.</p>

    <h3>How would you describe your work?</h3>
    <p>Self-expression and therapy. My drawings are a way to express emotions that are hard to put into words. Drawing makes me feel better, gives me positive energy, and helps me understand myself.</p>

    <h3>What do you hope people take away from your art?</h3>
    <p>I hope viewers feel a personal and emotional connection to my work. I want my art to spark thought, whether it brings joy, contemplation, or even discomfort. If one person feels inspired or moved, then I’ve succeeded.</p>

    <h3>How does being an artist affect your outlook on life?</h3>
    <p>It makes me see the world with more awareness and appreciation. I notice beauty in unexpected places, from city skylines to nature’s patterns. Art has taught me to embrace change and face challenges with curiosity and creativity.</p>

    <h3>How do you feel while you’re working?</h3>
    <p>Creating art brings me joy and relief. I often enter a state of flow where my mind is clear, and I’m filled with positive energy.</p>

    <h3>Do you have any rituals when working?</h3>
    <p>I like listening to music, podcasts, or sometimes just working in silence. I don’t have a studio; I work on the same table where I eat, but preparing a clean, empty space before starting is essential to me.</p>

    <h3>What does your typical working day look like?</h3>
    <p>It’s challenging with a full-time job, but I dedicate at least two hours every evening to drawing. Often, I work directly on the paper without sketching first.</p>

    <p><em>Amer Musa’s exhibition is open at Rue de Grenelle and Boulevard Raspail in Paris until 6 August 2023.</em></p>
