    <p style="text-align:center; max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto;">
      My name is Amer Musa, a contemporary artist based in Paris.  
      I create drawings and paintings that explore minimal, geometric forms and emotional expression.  
      Art has been my way to connect with the world, starting as a form of therapy and evolving into my true passion.

        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I was born in Sudan and moved to France in 2017. My artistic journey began as a self-taught practice, 
          discovering the power of creativity during challenging times.  
          My work often reflects memory, light, and the silent poetry of daily life.
        </p>

        <h3>My Work</h3>
        <p>
          I primarily use markers and oil pastels to create vibrant, graphic compositions.  
          My pieces combine simplicity with depth, inviting viewers to pause and reflect.  
          My artwork has been exhibited in Paris, including a special collaboration with Paul Smith.
