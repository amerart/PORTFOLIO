  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in Sudan and arrived in Paris in 2017. At the time, I didn’t speak the language, had no home, and knew nothing about art.
    One day, I picked up a marker and started to draw — not to impress, but to heal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, drawing became my language. Through repetition, geometry, and quiet forms, I explore memory, solitude, and space.
    Today, I live and work in Paris, sharing what was once private: the art of staying silent, and the beauty of finding light in limited colors.
